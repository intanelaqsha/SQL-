Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

-- BEGIN SQL CODE
 SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM table
-- END SQL CODE
	
        Table name            Total number of records
-----------------------------------------------------------
i.      Attribute table     = 10000
ii.     Business table      = 10000
iii.    Category table      = 10000
iv.     Checkin table       = 10000
v.      elite_years table   = 10000 
vi.     friend table        = 10000
vii.    hours table         = 10000
viii.   photo table         = 10000
ix.     review table        = 10000
x.      tip table           = 10000
xi.     user table          = 10000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
    FROM table

i.      Business            = id: 10000
ii.     Hours               = business_id: 1562
iii.    Category            = business_id: 2643
iv.     Attribute           = business_id: 1115
v.      Review              = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi.     Checkin             = business_id: 493
vii.    Photo               = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii.   Tip                 = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix.     User                = id: 10000
x.      Friend              = user_id: 11
xi.     Elite_years         = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.
